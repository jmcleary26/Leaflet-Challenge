# Leaflet-Challenge

For the leaflet challenge, we were tasked with plotting a map of earthquake data from USGS.gov using Leaflet. I chose a dataset including all earthquake data from the past 7 days and  created a map using leaflet that plotted all earthquake data with bubbles based on their magnitude and colored the bubbles based on the depth of the earth. I also added popup feature that displayed more information about the earthquake location, magnitude, and depth when you click on each bubble. I then added a color legend for the bubbles so that the website visitor can easily see which earthquakes had greater depths than others.
